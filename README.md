'On-Body Circular Patch Antenna for Breast Cancer Detection'
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Main ideas of this project; The main goal of this thesis based project(Capstone Project) is to detect the presence of breast cancer tumors in women by 
 the variation of S11 parameter of a microstrip patch antenna.
 In Simulation works, we experimented the Rectangular & Circular microstrip patch antenna design with CST Software(CST Studio Suite).
